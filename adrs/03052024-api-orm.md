# AD: Object-Relational Mapper for the api
**Decider:** Kai Pietruska

## Context and Problem Statement
What ORM do we use to implement our api?

## Decision Drivers
We want to use a ORM, so that we don't have to deal with raw SQL queries and we can modify our database easily.
It should generate SQL queries from Go code, since we already have our Go code.

## Considered Options
- GORM
- ent
- gorp

## Decision Outcome
gorp because it is lightwight and brings all the features we need for our use case.
GORM is nice but brings a lot of overhead and features we don't need.
ent has a steep learning curve.


## Consequences
